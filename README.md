# Information-Theory-Practical-Tutos
This repository contains a series of practical tutorials on Information Theory, written in Matlab. The tutorials are designed to introduce students to key concepts in Information Theory and provide hands-on experience with coding and problem solving.

## Getting Started
To use these tutorials, you will need to have Matlab installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official website: https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/.

Each tutorial is contained within a separate folder and includes a .m script file and a report. To run the tutorial, simply open the script file in Matlab and follow the instructions provided in the comments(easy to do!!).

## Tutorials
The tutorials in this repository cover a range of topics in Information Theory, including:

Entropy and Information
Conditional Entropy and Mutual Information
Channel Capacity and Rate Distortion Theory
Source Coding and Huffman Coding
Channel Coding and Error Correction
Each tutorial includes detailed explanations of the concepts and algorithms involved, as well as code examples and practice problems.

## Conclusion
These tutorials provide a comprehensive introduction to Information Theory and are a valuable resource for students in computer science, electrical engineering, and related fields. By completing the tutorials and practice problems, you will gain an understanding of the fundamental principles of Information Theory and be better equipped to apply these concepts in your own work.
